| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| PORT | Port for the server to listen on | 3000 | No |
| DUMBKAN_PIN | PIN protection (4-10 digits) | - | No |

## PIN Protection
When `DUMBKAN_PIN` is set, the app requires PIN verification before accessing or modifying boards. The PIN must be 4-10 digits long.

## Data Persistence
Task data is stored in `/app/data/tasks.json`. When using Docker, mount this directory as a volume to persist data between container restarts.

## Getting Started

1. Pull the image:
   ```bash
   docker pull dumbwareio/dumbkan:latest
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data --env-file .env dumbwareio/dumbkan:latest
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```

### Option 2: Local Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   ```

2. Install dependencies:

3. Start the server:

   User=root
   # It's better to run as a non-root user if possible
   
   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   Then run

   ``` shell
   sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
